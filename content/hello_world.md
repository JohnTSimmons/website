First post with Zola after moving off of Quartz.

<!-- more -->

Zola is a static site generator made in the Rust language. I mainly chose it due to its fair documentation, and I hope to contribute to it as well once I learn more Rust. The theme is "Terminimal", which I lightly modfied to fit my aesthetic preferences.

Previously this URL pointed to a website built with Quartz, which is a static site generator made for Obsidian.md vaults. I moved off of Quartz because I did not enjoy the "Obsidian" features anymore, and wanted a more basic markdown-to-html solution. I enjoyed Quartz, but it was programmed in typescript, which I currently have little skill in. 

The next project with this website is to make some content for it; mainly documenting some of my projects and work. My next task for this website in particular is to add search functionality, which I plan to do with fuse most likely.

Thanks for reading.
