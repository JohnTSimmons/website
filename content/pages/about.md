Hello, welcome to my website!

I'm John Simmons, currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Science and Technology in Missouri, USA.

My interests include:

* Open Source Software
* Linux, specifically Arch
* Programming
  * Rust
  * C++
  * Python
* Embedded programming
* Making toy video games in Godot
  * Hopefully will release something professionally one day

Currently I am studying Calculus, Physics, Data Structures/Algorithms, and Microcontroller Programming.

I currently work for the Missouri S&T Russian Linguistics Research Group, as a graduate research assistant. I am studying Russian word formation synthesis, using web-scraping and computational linguistics methods.

I hope to work someday as a professional software engineer.
